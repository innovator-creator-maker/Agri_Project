# Agri_Project This project is of data science 

the dataset is downloaded form kaggle.com source : https://www.kaggle.com/samextensibleenergy/agricultural-commodity-dataset

My name is Samarth Pandey and i have written it for event hosted by AI Student Community 

Libraries used are pandas and matplotlib 

If running in jupyter notebook or pycharm or any plz note that the csv file should be in the same directorys as the 
code.

for using a csv in other file specify it path and use  df  = pd.read("the location goes here") command.

Thankyou!
